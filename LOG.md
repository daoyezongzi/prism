## 2026-09-01 — Independent repository foundation

### Decisions

- `Prism.md` is the project master document; no duplicate `PROJECT.md` will be created.
- Prism is an independent repository. `tradeeye-copilot` and `TradeEye` remain read-only upstream references and are not runtime dependencies.
- The first product slice is portfolio-to-adjustment decision support for a technology-fund-concentrated user, not a broad financial chat clone.
- The runtime will be a modular monolith with a bounded structured research DAG. LLM nodes do not calculate financial facts or bypass deterministic profile, portfolio, risk and compliance engines.
- Product differentiation is an auditable personalized adjustment delta: the user can see which profile constraint changed the recommendation, the quantified pre/post effect, the evidence chain and the invalidation conditions.
- Fund/ETF look-through analysis moves into P0 because the flagship scenario depends on it. The load-test harness also moves forward to the Provider/foundation phase.

### Upstream evidence

- `tradeeye-copilot` at `1675a87`, equal to `origin/main`, clean: 283 tests passed.
- `TradeEye` at `8a1bd8c`, equal to `origin/main`, clean: 172 tests passed.
- Reusable code and non-reusable strategy/storage boundaries are recorded in `docs/reuse-matrix.md`.
- Neither upstream root exposed a `LICENSE`, `COPYING`, or `NOTICE` file during the current inspection; provenance remains a submission gate.

### Implemented

- Initialized Git on branch `main`.
- Updated the master specification to identify `Prism.md`—not a duplicate `PROJECT.md`—as the execution entrypoint.
- Added project metadata, repository hygiene files and a truthful README.
- Added ADR-0001, implementation architecture, Reuse Matrix, Evidence Contract and a durable foundation plan.
- Added strict immutable Pydantic contracts for Evidence, Fact, Finding, Recommendation and DecisionTrace.
- Enforced timezone-aware retrieval timestamps, non-zero-vs-missing semantics, reference closure, matching fact/evidence values and periods, and independent compliance states.
- Allowed missing evidence to explain a `BLOCKED` decision while preventing it from supporting actionable recommendations.

### Verification

```text
python -m pytest
8 passed
```

This verifies only the initial domain contract. No real SkillHub request, financial recommendation, browser workflow, concurrency target or availability target is claimed yet.

### Open constraints

- Competition-specific SkillHub interface and usage authorization are not present in the repository.
- The scoring appendix referenced in the brief is not present in the repository.
- Storage, Provider, profile, research, portfolio, risk, compliance, API and Web workbench remain unimplemented.

## 2026-09-01 — Gemini MVP Phase 1 delegation contract

### Decision

- Gemini may execute the overall MVP route one accepted phase at a time; it does not own or rewrite the route in `Prism.md`.
- The first delegated phase is narrowed to the fixture-first Provider boundary. Live SkillHub, storage, profile, research, portfolio and UI are explicitly excluded.
- Each Gemini phase must run on an isolated branch/worktree, satisfy an executable acceptance contract, create a local commit without pushing, and return evidence for independent review.
- Provider call identity is split into a per-call `request_id` and a deterministic semantic `request_fingerprint`; credentials are excluded from both fixtures and fingerprints.

### Artifact

- Added `docs/plans/2026-09-01-mvp-phase-1-provider-protocol.md` as the copy-ready Gemini execution contract.
- The contract defines allowed files, four-state invariants, fixture data, timeout/redaction behavior, Evidence conversion, a 100-request isolation smoke test, stop conditions and the required handoff format.

### Current evidence boundary

- This change is planning only. No Provider implementation or real external request has been added.
- Phase 1 remains incomplete until Gemini's implementation is independently reviewed and accepted.

### Verification

- Existing baseline: `python -m pytest` -> 8 passed.
- Python compilation: passed.
- Local Markdown link validation: passed.
- Staged diff check: passed.

## 2026-09-01 — MVP Phase 1 fixture-first provider protocol

### Decisions

- Implemented the fixture-first Provider Protocol strictly adhering to `docs/plans/2026-09-01-mvp-phase-1-provider-protocol.md`.
- Enforced strict four-state execution invariants: `SUCCESS`, `PARTIAL`, `EMPTY`, and `FAILED` cannot be interchanged or masqueraded.
- Separated per-call correlation (`request_id`) from deterministic canonical SHA-256 semantic query fingerprints (`request_fingerprint`).
- Hardened contract safety based on review feedback:
  - Added `FrozenDict` deep immutability to prevent runtime parameter mutation and fingerprint drift;
  - Added recursive forbidden key detection (`_find_forbidden_key`) traversing nested dictionaries and sequences;
  - Enforced per-record required field validation in `SUCCESS` (requiring all records to have all required fields with non-None values);
  - Enforced veracity checking on `PARTIAL.missing_fields` (ensuring missing fields were actually requested and actually missing in records);
  - Added record identity to `evidence_id` (`ev:{provider}:{source}:{record_identity}:{field}:{period}`) to prevent duplicate Evidence IDs across multiple records and ensure DecisionTrace closure;
  - Added fixture template validation and duplicate fingerprint detection at FixtureProvider initialization.
- Created purely synthetic, credential-free fixtures covering all four result states.
- Normalization safely converts `SUCCESS` to `VERIFIED` Evidence, `PARTIAL` to `PARTIAL` Evidence with quality notes, and `EMPTY`/`FAILED` to zero Evidence (preventing false zeros).
- Standard library `asyncio` execution budget wrapper maps timeouts and internal errors safely without leaking stack traces or credentials.
- 100-concurrent request in-memory smoke test verified request ID isolation and fingerprint stability.

### Implemented

- `app/providers/contracts.py`: ProviderOperation, ProviderStatus, ProviderIssueCode, FrozenDict, ProviderRequest, ProviderRecord, ProviderIssue, ProviderResult, FinancialProvider protocol, and validate_result_for_request.
- `app/providers/fingerprint.py`: canonical JSON request dictionary, SHA-256 fingerprinting, and recursive redaction.
- `app/providers/fixture.py`: FixtureFinancialProvider with in-memory fingerprint indexing, template validation, and deterministic execution.
- `app/providers/runtime.py`: execute_with_budget async wrapper with timeout and error mapping.
- `app/providers/normalization.py`: normalize_result_to_evidence converter to Evidence domain model with record-identity-aware Evidence IDs.
- `app/providers/__init__.py`: package exports.
- `tests/fixtures/providers/*.json`: synthetic test fixtures (fund_data_success, fund_data_partial, fund_data_empty, fund_data_failed).
- `tests/unit/test_provider_contract.py`, `tests/unit/test_provider_fingerprint.py`, `tests/integration/test_fixture_provider.py`: 35 new tests covering all 21 acceptance cases and 6 review hardening items (43 total tests in repo).
- `docs/provider-protocol.md`: comprehensive documentation of the provider protocol.

### Verification

```text
python -m pytest
43 passed in 0.33s

python -m compileall -q app
passed

python -c "from app.providers import FinancialProvider, FixtureFinancialProvider; print('provider-import-ok')"
provider-import-ok

git diff --check
passed
```

### Current evidence boundary

- Live SkillHub network requests, production credentials, storage persistence, user profiles, research DAG, and UI workbench remain un-implemented and are explicitly out-of-scope for Phase 1.
